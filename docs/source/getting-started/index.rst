Getting Started
===============

Overview
--------
At its core the Monuva platform enables businesses and individuals to make and receive payments into and out of their multi-currency accounts.

Accounts
--------
Accounts can be topped-up by either making card payments, by sending us a bank transfer quoting your unique customer reference or by issuing invoices to customers that 
are then paid. Balances held on account can then either be converted to other currencies, transferred for free to other Monuva account holders or withdrawn and sent 
to a bank account.

Invoicing
---------
Monuva provides a powerful invoicing platform that enables businesses to issue invoices to customers in one currency whilst allowing customers to pay in another. Invoiced  
items can be priced in different currencies and then aggregated and converted back to a single invoiced amount to be paid by the customer. Payment plans can be set up
with configurable due dates and late fees set per instalment giving both you and your customers great flexibility. Then by embedding our invoice payment form in your website
you are also able to collect these payments without your customers having to leave your website.   

Agencies
--------
If you allow brokers or resellers to issue invoices on your behalf it is possible to set up a flexible agency agreement between you and other Monuva account holders enabling
commission payments to be made instantly and at source.
